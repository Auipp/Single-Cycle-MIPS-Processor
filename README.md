# Single-Cycle MIPS Processor

Structural and behavioral implementation of a Single-Cycle MIPS Processor written in VHDL.

## Project Overview
This project implements the core components of a MIPS datapath and control unit, capable of executing a fundamental subset of MIPS-32 instructions. 

**Developed using Xilinx ISE.**
